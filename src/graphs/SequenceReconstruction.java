  //You are given an integer array nums of length n where nums is a permutation of the integers in the range [1, n].
  // You are also given a 2D integer array sequences where sequences[i] is a subsequence of nums.
  // Check if nums is the shortest possible and the only supersequence. The shortest supersequence is a sequence with
  // the shortest length and has all sequences[i] as subsequences. There could be multiple valid supersequences for the
  // given array sequences.
  //For example, for sequences = [[1,2],[1,3]], there are two shortest supersequences, [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
  //While for sequences = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,2,3]], the only shortest supersequence possible is [1,2,3]. [1,2,3,4] is a
  // possible supersequence but not the shortest.
